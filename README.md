# Project-16
## INFRASTRCTURE AS CODE (IaC) - AUTOMATE AWS CLOUD SOLUTION FOR 2 COMPANY WEBSITES USING A REVERSE PROXY TECHNOLOGY WITH TERRAFORM

![Alt text](Images/1.aws-website-architecture.png)

### Prerequisites

1. Create an IAM user, name it *terraform* (ensure that the user has only programatic access to your AWS account) and grant this user AdministratorAccess permissions.
1. Copy the secret access key and access key ID. Save them in a notepad temporarily.
1. Configure programmatic access from your workstation to connect to AWS using the access keys copied above. Ensure You have Python 3.6 or higher on your workstation.

![Alt text](Images/1.iam-user-create.png)

consider using GitBash If you are on Windows.

For easier authentication configuration – use AWS CLI with aws configure command.

Create an S3 bucket to store Terraform state file. You can name it something like *yourname*-dev-terraform-bucket (Note: S3 bucket names must be unique unique within a region partition) - We will use this bucket from Project-17 onwards.

![Alt text](Images/1.create-bucket-created.png)

make sure you can programmatically access your AWS account by running following commands in AWS cli

```
aws s3 ls
```

You shall see your previously created S3 bucket name – *yourname*-dev-terraform-bucket

### The secrets of writing quality Terraform code

The secret recipe of a successful Terraform projects consists of:

 - Your understanding of your goal (desired AWS infrastructure end state)
 - Your knowledge of the IaC technology used (in this case – Terraform)
 - Your ability to effectively use up-to-date Terraform documentation [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration).

As you go along completing this project, you will get familiar with Terraform-specific terminology, such as:

 - [Attribute](https://www.terraform.io/docs/glossary.html#attribute)
 - [Resource](https://www.terraform.io/docs/glossary.html#resource)
 - [Interpolations](https://www.terraform.io/docs/glossary.html#interpolation)
 - [Argument](https://www.terraform.io/docs/glossary.html#argument)
 - [Providers](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html)
 - [Provisioners](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/resources/provisioners/index.html)
 - [Input Variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/glossary.html#variables)
 - [Output Variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/glossary.html#output-values)
 - [Module](https://www.terraform.io/docs/glossary.html#module)
 - [Data Source](https://www.terraform.io/docs/glossary.html#data-source)
 - [Local Values](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration-0-11/locals.html)
 - [Backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/glossary.html#backend)

Make sure you understand them and know when to use each of them.

### Best practices
 - Ensure that every resource is tagged using multiple key-value pairs. You will see this in action as we go along.
 - Try to write reusable code, avoid hard coding values wherever possible. (For learning purpose, we will start by hard coding, but gradually refactor our work to follow best practices).

## VPC | SUBNETS | SECURITY GROUPS

## VPC 

### Create a directory structure
Open your Visual Studio Code and:

 - Create a folder called PBL
 - Create a file in the folder, name it main.tf

![Alt text](Images/1.vscode-mainfolder-create.png)

### Provider and VPC resource section

Set up Terraform CLI as per [this instruction](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).

 - Add AWS as a *provider*, and a *resource* to create a VPC in the *main.tf* file.
 - Provider block informs Terraform that we intend to build infrastructure within AWS.
 - Resource block will create a VPC.

 coppy the snippet below:

 ```
 provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"
}

# Create VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block                     = "172.16.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_support             = "true"
  enable_dns_hostnames           = "true"
  enable_classiclink             = "false"
  enable_classiclink_dns_support = "false"
}
 
 ```

![Alt text](Images/1.aws-provider.png)

 **Note:** You can change the configuration above to create your VPC in other region that is closer to you. The same applies to all configuration snippets that will follow.

 - The next thing we need to do, is to download necessary plugins for Terraform to work. These plugins are used by *providers* and *provisioners*. 
At this stage, we only have provider in our *main.tf* file. So, Terraform will just download plugin for AWS provider.

 - Lets accomplish this with *terraform init* command as seen below.

![Alt text](Images/1.terraform-init.png)

#### Observations:

Notice that a new directory has been created: .terraform\.... This is where Terraform keeps plugins. 
Generally, it is safe to delete this folder. It just means that you must execute terraform init again, to download them.

Moving on, let us create the only resource we just defined. *aws_vpc*. But before we do that, we should check to see what terraform intends to create before we tell it to go ahead and create it.

Run *terraform plan*

![Alt text](Images/1.terraform-plan.png) 

Then, if you are happy with changes planned, execute *terraform apply*

![Alt text](Images/1.terraform-plan1.png)

#### Observations:

A new file is created *terraform.tfstate* This is how Terraform keeps itself up to date with the exact state of the infrastructure. It reads this file to know what already exists, what should be added, or destroyed based on the entire terraform code that is being developed.

If you also observed closely, you would realize that another file gets created during planning and apply. But this file gets deleted immediately. *terraform.tfstate.lock.info* This is what Terraform uses to track, who is running its code against the infrastructure at any point in time. This is very important for teams working on the same Terraform repository at the same time. The lock prevents a user from executing Terraform configuration against the same infrastructure when another user is doing the same – it allows to avoid duplicates and conflicts.

Its content is usually like this.

    {
        "ID":"e5e5ad0e-9cc5-7af1-3547-77bb3ee0958b",
        "Operation":"OperationTypePlan","Info":"",
        "Who":"name@name","Version":"0.13.4",
        "Created":"2020-10-28T19:19:28.261312Z",
        "Path":"terraform.tfstate"
    }

It is a json format file that stores information about a user: user’s ID, what operation he/she is doing, timestamp, and location of the state file.

### Subnets resource section

According to our architectural design above, we will require 6 subnets:

- 2 public
- 2 private for webservers
- 2 private for data layer

Let us create the first 2 public subnets.

Add below configuration to the main.tf file:

```
# Create public subnets1
    resource "aws_subnet" "public1" {
    vpc_id                     = aws_vpc.main.id
    cidr_block                 = "172.16.0.0/24"
    map_public_ip_on_launch    = true
    availability_zone          = "eu-west-2a"

}

# Create public subnet2
    resource "aws_subnet" "public2" {
    vpc_id                     = aws_vpc.main.id
    cidr_block                 = "172.16.1.0/24"
    map_public_ip_on_launch    = true
    availability_zone          = "eu-west-2b"
}
```


 - We are creating 2 subnets, therefore declaring 2 resource blocks – one for each of the subnets.
 - We are using the *vpc_id* argument to interpolate the value of the VPC *id* by setting it to *aws_vpc.main.id*. This way, Terraform knows inside which VPC to create the subnet.

Run terraform plan and terraform apply

![Alt text](Images/1.subnet-create.png)

#### Observations:

- Hard coded values: Remember our best practice hint from the beginning? Both the *availability_zone* and *cidr_block* arguments are hard coded. We should always endeavour to make our work dynamic.

- Multiple Resource Blocks: Notice that we have declared multiple resource blocks for each subnet in the code. This is bad coding practice. We need to create a single resource block that can dynamically create resources without specifying multiple blocks. Imagine if we wanted to create 10 subnets, our code would look very clumsy. So, we need to optimize this by introducing a *count* argument.

**Now let us improve our code by refactoring it.**

First, destroy the current infrastructure. Since we are still in development, this is totally fine. Otherwise, **DO NOT DESTROY** an infrastructure that has been deployed to production.

To destroy whatever has been created run *terraform destroy* command, and type yes after evaluating the plan.

## FIXING THE PROBLEMS BY CODE REFACTORING

- **Fixing Hard Coded Values:** We will introduce variables, and remove hard coding.

1. Starting with the provider block, declare a variable named region, give it a default value, and update the provider section by referring to the declared variable.

   variable "region" {
        default = "eu-west-2"
    }

    provider "aws" {
        region = var.region
    }
2. Do the same to *cidr* value in the *vpc* block, and all the other arguments.

variable "region" {
        default = "eu-west-2"
    }

    variable "vpc_cidr" {
        default = "172.16.0.0/16"
    }

    variable "enable_dns_support" {
        default = "true"
    }

    variable "enable_dns_hostnames" {
        default ="true" 
    }

   
    provider "aws" {
    region = var.region
    }

    # Create VPC
    resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
    cidr_block                     = var.vpc_cidr
    enable_dns_support             = var.enable_dns_support 
    enable_dns_hostnames           = var.enable_dns_support
    
    }

![Alt text](Images/1.variable.png)

- **Fixing multiple resource blocks:** This is where things become a little tricky. It’s not complex, we are just going to introduce some interesting concepts. *Loops* & *Data sources*

Terraform has a functionality that allows us to pull data which exposes information to us. For example, every region has Availability Zones (AZ). Different regions have from 2 to 4 Availability Zones. With over 20 geographic regions and over 70 AZs served by AWS, it is impossible to keep up with the latest information by hard coding the names of AZs. Hence, we will explore the use of Terraform’s **Data Sources** to fetch information outside of Terraform. In this case, from **AWS**

Let us fetch Availability zones from AWS, and replace the hard coded value in the subnet’s *availability_zone* section.

```
# Get list of availability zones
        data "aws_availability_zones" "available" {
        state = "available"
        }
```
To make use of this new data resource, we will need to introduce a count argument in the subnet block: Something like this.

```
  # Create public subnet1
    resource "aws_subnet" "public" { 
        count                   = 2
        vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
        cidr_block              = "172.16.1.0/24"
        map_public_ip_on_launch = true
        availability_zone       = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[count.index]
    
    }
```
![Alt text](Images/1.variable1.png)

To quickly understand what is going on here.

- The count tells us that we need 2 subnets. Therefore, Terraform will invoke a loop to create 2 subnets.
- The data resource will return a list object that contains a list of AZs. Internally, Terraform will receive the data like this ["eu-west-2a", "eu-west-2b"]

Each of them is an index, the first one is index *0*, while the other is index *1*. If the data returned had more than 2 records, then the index numbers would continue to increment.

Therefore, each time Terraform goes into a loop to create a subnet, it must be created in the retrieved AZ from the list. Each loop will need the index number to determine what AZ the subnet will be created. That is why we have *data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[count.index]* as the value for availability_zone. When the first loop runs, the first index will be *0*, therefore the AZ will be *eu-west-2a*. The pattern will repeat for the second loop.


But we still have a problem. If we run Terraform with this configuration, it may succeed for the first time, but by the time it goes into the second loop, it will fail because we still have *cidr_block* hard coded. The same *cidr_block* cannot be created twice within the same VPC. So, we have a little more work to do.

#### Let’s make cidr_block dynamic.

We will introduce a function *cidrsubnet()* to make this happen. It accepts 3 parameters. Let us use it first by updating the configuration, then we will explore its internals.

```
   # Create public subnet1
    resource "aws_subnet" "public" { 
        count                   = 2
        vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
        cidr_block              = cidrsubnet(var.vpc_cidr, 4 , count.index)
        map_public_ip_on_launch = true
        availability_zone       = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[count.index]

    }
```

A closer look at *cidrsubnet* – this function works like an algorithm to dynamically create a subnet CIDR per AZ. Regardless of the number of subnets created, it takes care of the cidr value per subnet.

Its parameters are *cidrsubnet(prefix, newbits, netnum)*

- The *prefix* this is The starting CIDR block. A parameter which must be given in CIDR notation, same as for VPC.
- The *newbits* parameter is the number of additional bits with which to extend the *prefix*. For example, if given a prefix ending with /16 and a newbits value of 4, the resulting subnet address will have length /20
- The *netnum* parameter is the subnet number within the range created by the previous two parameters. It is a whole number that can be represented as a binary integer with no more than *newbits* binary digits, which will be used to populate the additional bits added to the prefix.

You can experiment how this works by entering the *terraform console* and keep changing the figures to see the output.

- On the terminal, run *terraform console*
- type cidrsubnet("172.16.0.0/16", 4, 0)
- Hit enter
- See the output
- Keep change the numbers and see what happens.
- To get out of the console, type exit

![Alt text](Images/1.cidr-subnet.png)

#### The final problem to solve is removing hard coded count value.

If we cannot hard code a value we want, then we will need a way to dynamically provide the value based on some input. Since the data resource returns all the AZs within a region, it makes sense to count the number of AZs returned and pass that number to the count argument.

To do this, we can introuduce *length()* function, which basically determines the length of a given list, map, or string.

Since *data.aws_availability_zones.available.names* returns a list like ["eu-west-2a", "eu-west-2b", "eu-west-2c"] we can pass it into a lenght function and get number of the AZs.

length(["eu-west-2a", "eu-west-2b", "eu-west-2c"])

Open up terraform console and try it

![Alt text](Images/1.length-function.png)

Now we can simply update the public subnet block like this

```
# Create public subnet1
    resource "aws_subnet" "public" { 
        count                   = length(data.aws_availability_zones.available.names)
        vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
        cidr_block              = cidrsubnet(var.vpc_cidr, 4 , count.index)
        map_public_ip_on_launch = true
        availability_zone       = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[count.index]

    }
```

#### Observations:

- What we have now, is sufficient to create the subnet resource required. But if you observe, it is not satisfying our business requirement of just 2 subnets. The length function will return number 3 to the count argument, but what we actually need is 2.

Now, let us fix this.

- Declare a variable to store the desired number of public subnets, and set the default value

```
variable "preferred_number_of_public_subnets" {
  default = 2
}
```
Next, update the *count* argument with a condition (Ternary Operator). Terraform needs to check first if there is a desired number of subnets. Otherwise, use the data returned by the lenght function. See how that is presented below.

```
# Create public subnets
resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  count  = var.preferred_number_of_public_subnets == null ? length(data.aws_availability_zones.available.names) : var.preferred_number_of_public_subnets   
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = cidrsubnet(var.vpc_cidr, 4 , count.index)
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  availability_zone       = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[count.index]

}
```
![Alt text](Images/1.ternary-operator.png)

Now lets break it down:

- The first part var.preferred_number_of_public_subnets == null checks if the value of the variable is set to null or has some value defined.
- The second part ? and length(data.aws_availability_zones.available.names) means, if the first part is true, then use this. In other words, if preferred number of public subnets is null (Or not known) then set the value to the data returned by lenght function.
- The third part : and var.preferred_number_of_public_subnets means, if the first condition is false, i.e preferred number of public subnets is not null then set the value to whatever is definied in var.preferred_number_of_public_subnets
